Module 3 Challenge for UT Data Analytics bootcamp


Module consist of two seperate pieces of code. One to find the the winner of an electrion, the other to find the financial status of bussiness.

I noticed that the bussiness results did not match the preview seen on the module, but a sanity check on the excel data shows the data generated match what was expected when using excel. My assumption is that my data isnt up to date but i trust the code to run as intented on any csv.

As for the election result. There is a possible edge case where two candidates have the same number of votes, the first candidate that appeared on the list will win. No indication was given on what to do in a tie so no fix was implimented.

Added a line of code i found online to set the terminal to be in the same location as the file being ran, this resulted in less errors from pathing.
